# Hastlayer - Core readme

The core logic of [Hastlayer](https://hastlayer.com/), those components that are the most important, dealing with various aspects of software to hardware transformation.

DEPRECATED! This is the repository where Hastlayer started. Previously the [Hastlayer SDK](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-SDK) contained the open-source half of the project and the logic here was private. Then we open-sourced this too and moved the code into the SDK repo, because there is no need for this separation any more.
