# Hastlayer - Core readme

The core logic of [Hastlayer](https://hastlayer.com/), those components that are the most important, dealing with various aspects of software to hardware transformation. These should be kept private.

DEPRECATED! This is the repository where Hastlayer was started, before factoring out the [Hastlayer SDK](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-SDK) into an open-source project but keeping the core logic private. Then, we open-sourced this too, moving the code to the SDK repo, since at that point, there was no use of having two repos.
